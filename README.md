# Linear-Regression

Checkout all my learnings about the most popular and one of the very basic machine learning algorithm - Linear Regression.
I have made 2 projects namely:
1. Salary Prediction of Employees in an organization
2. House Price Prediction 

The projects demonstrate my solid understanding of the model.
I have also made a file that has got a sort of documentation which I often use to revise the concepts of Linear Regression.
