# Linear-Regression

Checkout my projects here, which utilize the most popular and one of the very basic machine learning algorithm - Linear Regression.
I have made 2 projects namely:

1. Salary Prediction of Employees in an organization (Salary_Prediction.ipynb)
2. House Price Prediction (House_Price_Prediction.ipynb)
   

The 1st project (salary prediction) has clean data (almost all the preprocessing steps are pre-applied) due to which it was little bit easier to implement the model/ make the project.
In the 2nd project (house price prediction) before I trained the model, I preprocessed the data to make it suitable for training.

3rd one is a very basic level project that I made to understand the simple linear regression, regression evaluation metrics, model training using sklearn etc...

The projects demonstrate my solid understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis, Linear Regression model & data pre-processing.
