# Linear-Regression

Checkout my projects here, which utilize the most popular and one of the very basic machine learning algorithm - Linear Regression.
I have made 2 projects namely:
1. Salary Prediction of Employees in an organization
2. House Price Prediction 

The 1st project (salary prediction) has clean data (almost all the preprocessing steps pre-applied) due to which it was little bit easier to implement the model/ make the project.
In the 2nd project (house price prediction) before I trained the data I have done preprocessed the data to make it suitable for training.

The projects demonstrate my solid understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis, Linear Regression model & data pre-processing.
